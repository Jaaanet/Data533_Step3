BudgetBuddy helps you track your income and expenses using simple steps.

   - All your transactions are saved under this profile.

2. Add Transactions
   - Open a profile from the Saved Profiles menu.
   - Choose "Record income" to add money you earned.
   - Choose "Record expense" to add money you spent.
   - Enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD), amount, category, and an optional description.

3. View Monthly Summary
   - BudgetBuddy automatically shows a summary page:
       • Total income for the month
       • Total expenses
       • Net balance (income – expenses)
       • Recent transactions
   - You can switch months anytime using "Change month".

4. Edit or Delete Transactions
   - From the profile menu:
       • Choose "Edit a transaction" to change any detail.
       • Choose "Delete a transaction" to remove an item.

5. Manage Profiles
   - From the Saved Profiles menu you can:
       • Open a profile
       • Rename a profile
       • Delete a profile
   - All changes are saved automatically.

6. Saving Data
   - Your profiles and transactions are stored in a JSON file.
   - The data is saved every time you exit or return to the main menu.

Tips:
   - Keep categories consistent (e.g., “Groceries”, “Rent”) to make summaries clearer.
   - Check your monthly net amount to see if you are overspending or saving.

Enjoy tracking your budget with BudgetBuddy!
